My primary role is dealing mixed damage types through various abilities. I should use Bad Doggie to punish enemies that get too close. Metal Hand provides reliable close-range damage with potential energy drain. Rocket Launcher gives me strong ranged options with multiple missiles. Target Locking allows me to redirect missed rockets for maximum efficiency. I can combine Rocket Launcher with Target Locking to deal heavy damage to a single target."
