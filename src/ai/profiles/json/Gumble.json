My Gooey Body passive makes me stronger in physical combat as my health increases. I should use Gummy Mallet for area damage and zone control. Royal Seal lets me control enemy movement by creating sticky traps. Boom Box provides both damage and displacement for tactical positioning. I excel at controlling space and punishing enemy positioning mistakes. I should maintain high health to maximize my passive physical damage bonuses."
