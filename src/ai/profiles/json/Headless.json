I should position behind enemies to maximize Larva Infest stacks. Cartilage Dagger lets me capitalize on fatigued enemies for double damage. Whip Move gives me strong positioning control to set up rear attacks. I excel at draining enemy endurance and punishing fatigued targets. I should actively maintain rear positioning for passive triggers."
