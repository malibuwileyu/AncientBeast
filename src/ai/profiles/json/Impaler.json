I should use Hasted Javelin for high pierce damage and movement reset. Poisonous Vine provides strong zone control and punishes movement. Chain Lightning gives me good AoE shock damage with arcing potential. I excel at energy management through shock conversion and mobility through Hasted Javelin. I should maintain good positioning to maximize Chain Lightning arcs."
