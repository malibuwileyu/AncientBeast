# Analysis Implementation Priorities

## Current Logs That Need Analysis Implementation

### 1. Movement Analysis
```typescript
// Currently just logging:
Movement: { from, to, distance }
Position Analysis: { escapeRoutes, threats, zones }
Strategic Impact: { quality, zoneControl, boardControl }

// Needs implementation:
- Evaluate position quality changes (not just logging them)
- Calculate tactical advantage of movement
- Assess whether movement achieved strategic goals
- Determine if better moves were available
```

### 2. Ability Analysis
```typescript
// Currently just logging:
Effects: { damage, movement, control, buff }
Resource Changes: { energy, plasma, endurance }
Combo Potential: { followUps, teamSynergies }

// Needs implementation:
- Evaluate ability usage effectiveness
- Calculate resource efficiency of the ability
- Assess if combo opportunities were utilized
- Determine if ability timing was optimal
```

### 3. Pattern Analysis
```typescript
// Currently just logging:
Pattern: { frequency, effectiveness, counterMeasures }

// Needs implementation:
- Actually detect meaningful patterns in unit behavior
- Calculate real effectiveness metrics
- Generate actionable counter strategies
- Track pattern success/failure rates
```

### 4. Resource Analysis
```typescript
// Currently just logging:
Current State: { energy, plasma, endurance }
Team Resources: { totalPlasma, efficiency }
Turn Usage: { energy, plasma, endurance }

// Needs implementation:
- Evaluate resource usage efficiency
- Calculate optimal resource timing
- Assess resource denial effectiveness
- Track resource advantage shifts
```

## Implementation Order

1. Movement Analysis
- Most fundamental to gameplay
- Clearest success/failure metrics
- Immediate tactical impact
```typescript
class MovementAnalyzer {
    evaluatePositionQuality(before: Position, after: Position): number;
    calculateTacticalAdvantage(movement: Movement): TacticalValue;
    assessStrategicSuccess(intent: Intent, result: Position): boolean;
    suggestBetterMoves(current: Movement): Movement[];
}
```

2. Ability Analysis
- Direct impact on game state
- Clear resource costs
- Measurable effectiveness
```typescript
class AbilityAnalyzer {
    evaluateEffectiveness(ability: Ability, result: Result): number;
    calculateResourceEfficiency(cost: Cost, impact: Impact): number;
    assessComboUtilization(ability: Ability, followUps: Ability[]): boolean;
    evaluateAbilityTiming(ability: Ability, gameState: State): TimingQuality;
}
```

3. Resource Analysis
- Supports ability analysis
- Affects long-term strategy
- Clear optimization metrics
```typescript
class ResourceAnalyzer {
    evaluateUsageEfficiency(spent: Resources, gained: Value): number;
    calculateOptimalTiming(current: Resources, planned: Usage): Timing;
    assessResourceControl(team: Resources, enemy: Resources): Advantage;
}
```

4. Pattern Analysis
- Builds on other analyses
- More complex to implement
- Long-term strategic value
```typescript
class PatternAnalyzer {
    detectBehaviorPatterns(history: Actions[]): Pattern[];
    calculatePatternSuccess(pattern: Pattern, results: Results[]): number;
    generateCounterStrategy(pattern: Pattern): Strategy;
}
```
