Ancient Beast AI Bot - Product Requirements Document
Overview
The Ancient Beast AI Bot project aims to create an intelligent opponent that uses genuine reasoning and strategic analysis rather than traditional game AI approaches. The bot will learn from games, adapt to player styles, and provide meaningful analytics.
Core Objectives
Create an AI opponent that reasons through game states using contextual understanding
Build a learning system that improves through accumulated game knowledge
Provide meaningful analytics for both AI and human players
Enhance the game's training potential through AI-driven insights
