# Metrics Implementation Plan

> See [metrics_development_roadmap.md](metrics_development_roadmap.md) for day-by-day implementation steps.
> See [metrics_technical_spec.md](metrics_technical_spec.md) for technical requirements.

## Core Approach
This implementation provides the foundation for AI decision making by:
1. Capturing complete game state
2. Analyzing state in real-time
3. Providing decision metrics
4. Enabling performance monitoring

## Implementation Phases

### 1. State Capture System
```typescript
class StateCapture {
  // Core interfaces only - see technical spec for details
  interface GameStateSnapshot {
    board: BoardState;
    units: UnitState[];
    resources: ResourceState;
    threats: ThreatState;
  }
}
```

### 2. Real-Time Analysis
```typescript
class RealTimeAnalyzer {
  // Analysis pipeline - see technical spec for implementation details
  interface TurnAnalysis {
    immediate: ImmediateState;
    tactical: TacticalAnalysis;
  }
}
```

### 3. Decision Metrics
```typescript
class DecisionMetrics {
  // Metrics framework for AI decisions
  interface ActionEvaluation {
    value: number;
    risks: RiskAssessment[];
    opportunities: OpportunityAssessment[];
  }
}
```

## Integration Framework
```typescript
// Core integration points
interface MetricsSystem {
  initialize(game: Game): void;
  update(state: GameState): void;
  getAnalysis(): Analysis;
  handleError(error: Error): void;
}
```

## Priority Implementation Order

1. State Capture (Week 1)
- Board state mapping
- Unit state tracking
- Resource state monitoring
- Basic threat mapping

2. Real-Time Analysis (Week 2)

- Position impact analysis

4. Integration (Week 3-4)
- Turn start integration
- Action evaluation
- Post-action analysis
- System optimization

## Success Metrics

1. Performance Metrics
